Move all zeroes to end of array.
Given an array of random numbers, Push all the zeroâ€™s of a given 
array to the end of the array. For example, if the given arrays 
is {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}, it should be changed 
to {1, 9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}. The order of all other elements should be same. 
Expected time complexity is O(n) and extra space is O(1).
